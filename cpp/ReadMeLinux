To run this on Linux, you need the shared object (so) files libflycapture.so.2 and libflycapture-c.so.2, which can be extracted from the .deb files from the website of those who make the FlyCapture library. The two .deb files I had to get these from were:
	libflycapture-2.11.3.121_amd64.deb
	libflycapture-c-2.11.3.121_amd64.deb
Naming may vary slightly.

You also need to set up a set of links (easily done using ln -s): 
	from libflycapture.so -> libflycapture.so.2 
	and from libflycapture-c.so -> libflycapture.so.2
	
Finally, you need to install the following dependencies:
1) libraw1394-11
2) libgtkmm-2.4-dev
3) libglademm-2.4-dev
4) libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev
5) libusb-1.0-0 (version 1.0.17 or greater recommended)

The README for FlyCapture gives the following command for Ubuntu 16.04:
sudo apt-get install libraw1394-11 libgtkmm-2.4-dev libglademm-2.4-dev libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev libusb-1.0-0

The following command is what I used on my Fedora 24 system:
sudo dnf install libraw1394 gtkmm24-devel libglademm24 gtkglextmm-devel libusb

I think that some of these dependencies (#2, #3 and #4) aren't actually needed for the library but are for the GUI application, but I'm not sure. I have them all installed.

You may need to do some setup of the raw1394 kernel module, and add a udev rule for your camera device. Since I don't have the camera hardware right now, I can't test it, but I will try to add more information once I have access to it.

=========================================================================
Some extra steps are also needed if you want to compile

You will need the header files (in this directory):
	fly2cam_FlyCamera.h (which is already here)
	FlyCapture2_C.h
	FlyCapture2Defs_C.h
	FlyCapture2Platform_C.h
I was able to extract the other three header files from libflycapture-c-2.11.3.121_amd64-dev.deb -- note that this is the "dev" version.

You can now compile the shared object file. The command that I used is below. It may vary slightly based on your JDK install location, so edit those accordingly (those paths need to be there to find jni.h and jni-md.h).

gcc -shared -o libFlyCamera.so -fPIC FlyCamera.cpp -L ./ -lflycapture -lflycapture-c -I . -I /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_91/include/ -I /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_91/include/linux/

=========================================================================
For the code to run on Linux, you MUST allocate more than the default 2MB of memory to USBFS (otherwise, you cannot get the 16-bit color depth and 640x320 resolution this code requests.)
Information for how to do so can be found on the Point Grey website (https://www.ptgrey.com/tan/10685#ConfiguringUSBFS).

For any further information, read the "ReadMe" file.
